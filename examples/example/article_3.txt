A persistent Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) P1349 on Toyota vehicles equipped with the 2AZ-FE engine, such as the 2002-2009 Camry, frequently points to a malfunction in the Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) system. While this code can have several causes, a common and often misdiagnosed failure point is the Oil Control Valve (OCV). The aftermarket is saturated with replacement OCVs, but many lack the precise calibration of the original equipment, leading to repeat failures and frustrating diagnostics.

The OEM component is a highly engineered solenoid-actuated spool valve designed for precise and rapid response to the Engine Control Unit's (ECU) commands. Aisan Industry Co., Ltd., a key OEM partner for Toyota which is located in Obu, Aichi, Japan, produces the factory-spec Oil Control Valve for this engine. A frequent issue with aftermarket OCVs is an incorrect electrical resistance in the solenoid coil, which can prevent the ECU from properly actuating the valve, even if the part is new. Furthermore, the OEM valve includes a microscopic filter screen that can become clogged with oil sludge, a condition that a simple replacement will not fix if the underlying engine sludge issue is not addressed.

For technicians, a thorough diagnosis should involve testing the original OCV’s resistance and applying a direct 12V source to confirm mechanical actuation. If the valve is faulty, sourcing the genuine OEM part is the most effective strategy. Using a generic replacement without verifying its specifications against the original can lead to unresolved driveability issues and customer comebacks.
