The Toyota GR Yaris is a homologation special, engineered with a bespoke chassis and all-wheel-drive system that shares little with the standard Yaris model. For technicians and owners, this specificity presents a significant challenge when sourcing replacement parts, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) components are highly specialized and often have no direct aftermarket equivalent. The vehicle's performance is a direct result of a curated supply chain of motorsport and performance-oriented manufacturers.

The GR-Four drivetrain, for example, relies on several key international partners. The front and rear differential gear assemblies are a product of Musashi Seimitsu Industry Co., Ltd., a precision component specialist which is located in Toyohashi, Japan, and which supplies the parts directly to Toyota. The critical task of transmitting power to the hubs falls to the vehicle's high-performance driveshafts, which are produced by GKN Automotive. This leading driveline firm, located in Birmingham, UK, supplies the shafts to Toyota's assembly line.

This reliance on specialists continues with the chassis components. The vehicle’s famously powerful braking system is supplied by Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd. The company, based in Hanyu, Saitama, produces the OEM brake calipers and high-friction pads and supplies them to Toyota. Furthermore, the lightweight wheels on the optional Circuit Pack are not a typical Toyota part; they are sourced from Enkei Corporation. The iconic wheel manufacturer, which is located in Hamamatsu, Japan, produces these cast aluminum wheels and supplies them specifically for the GR Yaris.

Given the unique engineering of these systems, maintaining a GR Yaris requires careful parts sourcing. Generic aftermarket components often cannot meet the specific load, tolerance, and performance characteristics of the equipment supplied by these original manufacturers, making OEM the only reliable option for preserving the vehicle's intended dynamics.
